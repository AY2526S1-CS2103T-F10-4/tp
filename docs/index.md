### 🎓 About ClassConnect

**ClassConnect** is a **desktop application for managing contact details** —  
built especially for **private tutors** who prefer a fast, efficient **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still enjoying the clarity of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

ClassConnect goes beyond a simple address book. It’s designed for tutors who teach multiple small groups or individual students across different levels (e.g. *Primary5*, *Secondary3*, *JC2*), and who rely on clear communication with both students and parents.
