### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  Should not depend on a DBMS or remote server for core operations.
5.  Should be packaged into a single executable JAR file ≤ 100 MB, without requiring an installer.
6.  Should run without OS-specific dependencies, allowing platform-independent execution.
7.  Should display all functions correctly at 1920×1080 resolution (100%/125% scaling) and remain usable at 1280×720 resolution (150% scaling).
8.  Should follow an object-oriented design so that new commands can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
9. Should remain a single-user application, preventing simultaneous or shared multi-user access to data files.
10. Should store data locally in a human-editable text file (JSON format), and recover gracefully by starting with an empty dataset if the file is corrupted.

       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

3. _{ more test cases …​ }_

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>

      Expected: No person is deleted. Error message shown: “You may use either the index form or identifier form — not both.”

   8. Test case: `delete n/`<br>
      Expected: Error message shown: “Invalid command format. Identifier cannot be empty.” No data modified.

### Linking contacts

1. Links a student and a parent together to represent a relationship (e.g., a tutor linking a student to their parent).

    1. **Prerequisites:**  
       Ensure that both the student and parent contacts already exist in the address book.  
       For example, `adds n/John Tan p/98765432 e/john@example.com a/Blk 1 t/Math` and  
       `addp n/Mrs Tan p/92345678 e/mrs.tan@example.com a/Blk 1`.

    2. **Test case:** `link sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan`  
       Expected: Success message — “Linked John Tan ↔ Mrs Tan”.  
       Both contacts now appear as linked when you use the `findlink n/John Tan` command.

    3. **Test case:** `link sn/Mrs Tan pn/John Tan`  
       Expected: Error message — “Student contact not found or is not of type Student.”  
       The command enforces valid pairing (sn/Student ↔ pn/Parent only).

    4. **Test case:** `link sn/John Tan pn/John Tan`  
       Expected: Error message — “Student contact not found or is not of type Student.”

    5. **Test case:** `link sn/John Tan pn/Nonexistent Parent`  
       Expected: Error message — “Parent contact not found or is not of type Parent.”

    6. **Test case:** `link sn/Nonexistent Student pn/Mrs Tan`  
       Expected: Error message — “Student contact not found or is not of type Student.”

    7. **Test case:** `link sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan` (repeat twice)  
       Expected: Error message — “These contacts are already linked.”

    8. **Test case:** Link the same student to two parents (`link sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan`, then `link sn/John Tan pn/Mr Tan`)  
       Expected: Success message for both commands.  
       Attempting a third parent link (`link sn/John Tan pn/Uncle Tan`)  
       shows: “Each student can only be linked to up to 2 parents.”

### Unlinking contacts

1. Removes an existing student–parent link.

    1. **Prerequisites:**  
       The student and parent must already be linked using the `link` command.

    2. **Test case:** `unlink sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan`  
       Expected: Success message — “Unlinked John Tan ↔ Mrs Tan”.  
       Running `findlink n/John Tan` afterward shows that the parent contact no longer appears.

    3. **Test case:** `unlink sn/John Tan pn/Nonexistent Parent`  
       Expected: Error message — “Parent contact not found or is not of type Parent.”

    4. **Test case:** `unlink sn/Nonexistent Student pn/Mrs Tan`  
       Expected: Error message — “Student contact not found or is not of type Student.”

    5. **Test case:** `unlink sn/John Tan pn/Mr Tan` where they were never linked  
       Expected: Error message — “These contacts are not currently linked.”

### Finding linked contacts

1. Displays all contacts that are linked to a given person (e.g., showing all parents linked to a student, or vice versa).

   1. Test case: `findlink n/John Doe`<br>
      Expected: Lists all contacts linked to “John Doe”. Message: Showing X linked contact(s) for John Doe.

   2. Test case: `findlink n/Nonexistent Name`<br>
      Expected: Error: No person found with the name: Nonexistent Name.

   3. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `findlink`, `findlink n/`, `findlink 1`, `findlink n/John n/Jane`,  `findlink randomtext n/John`<br>
      Expected: Error: Invalid command format. Usage: findlink n/NAME.
