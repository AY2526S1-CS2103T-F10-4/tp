### Adding a contact: `adds`/`addp`

Adds a student (with `adds`) or a parent (with `addp`) to the address book.<br>

All contacts contain an **_optional_** `remark` field and the following **_compulsory_** fields:
- `name`
- `phone number`
- `email`
- `address`<br>

Students contain an additional **_optional_** `tags` field<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** Only existing tags in the tag list can be added to a student.<br>
Use the `add_tags` command to add new tags before use.
</div>

Format (Parent): `addp n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/REMARK]` <br>
Format (Student): `adds n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [r/REMARK] [t/TAG]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**
A student can have any number of tags (including 0).<br>
The order of fields does not matter. e.g. `adds p/98765432 n/John Doe...` is also acceptable.
</div>

Examples:
* `adds n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 t/Math`
* `addp n/Betsy Crowe e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567`

### Locating contacts by name: `find`

Finds contacts whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be shown.
  e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  <img src="images/findAlexDavidResult.png" alt="find alex david" width="400" style="height:auto;">

### Editing a contact : `edit`

Edits an existing contact in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`

* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be replaced.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**
Only student contacts can have tags, so updates to the tag with `t/` only applies to student contacts.<br>
</div>


Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX` or `delete [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [p/PHONE]`

* Deletes the person at the specified INDEX, or deletes the person that matches the provided identifier(s).
* The index refers to the number shown in the current displayed person list.
* The index must be a positive number 1, 2, 3, …
* When using identifiers:
* `n/NAME` — matches the full name (case-insensitive).
* `e/EMAIL` — matches the exact email address (case-insensitive).
* `p/PHONE` — matches the exact phone number.
* You must use either the index form or the identifier form — not both in the same command.
* If multiple people match, the app reports that the command is ambiguous and requests you to specify more identifiers.
* If no match is found, the app will show a no match found message.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**
If you are unsure of a contact’s full name, use identifiers such as email or phone number to avoid deleting the wrong person.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.
* `delete n/John Doe` deletes the person named “John Doe”.
* `delete e/alice@example.com` deletes the person with that email.
* `delete p/91234567` deletes the person with that phone number.
* `delete n/John Tan e/john.tan@example.com` deletes the correct “John Tan” by email.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`


### Linking a student and parent : `link`

Links an existing student contact with a parent contact so that their contacts will display each other's name.

Format: `link sn/STUDENT_NAME pn/PARENT_NAME`

* `sn/` — name of the student contact (required)
* `pn/` — name of the parent contact (required)

Examples:
* `link sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan` Links student John Tan with parent Mrs Tan.

Notes:
* A student can be linked to a maximum of 2 parents (e.g., mother and father).
* A parent can be linked to multiple students (e.g., their children).
* Link relationships are automatically saved in the data file and reloaded when the app restarts.
* Deleting a contact automatically removes all links associated with that contact.

### Unlinking a student and parent : `unlink`
Removes an existing link between a student and a parent contact, so you cannot see their names under each other's contact.

Format: `unlink sn/STUDENT_NAME pn/PARENT_NAME`

* `sn/` — name of the student contact (required)
* `pn/` — name of the parent contact (required)

Examples:
* unlink sn/John Tan pn/Mrs Tan `Removes the link between John Tan and Mrs Tan.`

### Finding linked contacts : `findlink`

Finds and displays all contacts that are linked to a specified person.

Format: `findlink n/NAME`

* Finds people who are linked to the specified person. 
  For example, if a student is linked to their parents, this command will display the parents’ contacts.
* Name matching is case-insensitive e.g. findlink n/Alice Tan, findlink n/aLiCe tAn both work
* The n/ prefix is required 
* If the person exists but has no linked contacts, the command will show that there are 0 linked results. 
* If no person matches the given name, an error message will be displayed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:**
If multiple contacts share similar names, ensure you specify the correct full name to accurately retrieve linked contacts.
</div>

Examples:
* `findlink n/Alice Tan` shows all contacts linked to Alice Tan (e.g. her parents).
* `findlink n/Tom Tan` shows all contacts linked to Tom Tan (e.g. his children).
* `findlink n/Bob Lee` shows “0 linked contact(s) for Bob Lee” if Bob Lee has no linked persons.
* `findlink n/Nonexistent Person` shows an error message indicating that no such person exists.

### Tag management
#### Adding tags : `addtag t/[TAG] t/[TAG]`
* Adds more possible tags to use
* It is possible to add multiple tags at once

#### Deleting tags : `deletetag t/[TAG] t/[TAG]`
* Deletes a tag type from the possible tags list. This will also delete the tag from all contacts who have this tag.
* It is possible to delete multiple tags at once

### Listing all contacts : `list`

Displays all contacts in the address book.

Format: `list`

### Filtering by tags: `filter`

Show students who have any of the tags given.

Format: `filter tag [MORE_TAGS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `Math` will match `math`
* The order of the tags does not matter.
* Only the tags are searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Math` will not match `Mathematics`
* Students with at least one tag will be shown.

Examples:
* John Doe has Math tag, Peter has Chem and Math tags
* `filter Math` shows `John Doe`
* `filter Math Chem` shows `John Doe` and `Peter`

### Viewing help : `help`

<img src="images/helpMessage.png" alt="help" width="400" style="height:auto;">
Format: `help`

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

**Q**: I closed ClassConnect by clicking the window’s close button instead of typing the exit command. Will I lose my work?<br>
**A**: Don’t worry, ClassConnect saves your updates automatically as you go. When you reopen the app, your most recent changes should still be there.

**Q**: Can I use ClassConnect on my phone or tablet?<br>
**A**: Not at the moment. ClassConnect is currently available only on desktop computers.

**Q**: What happens if a student leaves and I delete their contact?<br>
**A**: Only the student is removed. Their parents remain safely in the address book — the family link is simply removed.

## Current limitations

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
